1. Data created during use of our services. This includes: 

•    Location data (driver, service provider and delivery person): We collect Drivers/Service Providers’ and Delivery/Service persons’ precise or approximate location data, including to enable services and deliveries, to enable services/delivery tracking and safety features, to prevent and detect fraud, and to satisfy legal requirements. The app collects this data when our app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device.
•    Location data (Customers and Delivery/Service recipients). We collect Customers’ and Delivery/Service recipients’ precise or approximate location data to enable and enhance use of our apps, including to improve pick-ups, facilitate deliveries, enable safety features, and prevent and detect fraud. 
We collect such data from users’ mobile devices if they enable us to do so. (See “Choice and transparency” below for information on how Customers and Delivery/Service recipients can enable location data collection). Our apps collects such data from the time a service or delivery is requested until it is finished (and may indicate such collection via an icon or notification on your mobile device depending on your device’s operating system), and any time the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) of their mobile device.
Customers and Delivery/Service recipients may use the  apps without enabling to collect precise location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect features in the apps. For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection will have to manually enter their pick-up address. In addition, the location data collected from a driver during a trip will be linked to the rider’s account, even if the rider has not enabled location data to be collected from their device, including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.

<p class="font-bold">9. Automated decision-making</p>
We use personal data to make automated decisions relating to use of our services. This includes:
•    enabling dynamic pricing, in which the price of a service, or the delivery fee for Tranzit Technologies orders, is determined based on constantly varying factors such as the estimated time and distance, the predicted route, estimated traffic, and the number of Customers and Drivers/Service Providers using at a given moment.
•    matching available Drivers/Service Providers and Delivery/Service persons to users requesting services. Users can be matched based on availability, proximity, and other factors such as likelihood to accept a trip based on their past behavior or preferences. 
•    determining user ratings, and deactivating users with low ratings. In the European Union or where otherwise required by law, such deactivation occurs only after human review and/or the possibility to appeal. Please also see the section below titled “Ratings look-up” for further information.
•    flagging users who are identified as having engaged in fraud, unsafe activity, or other activities that may harm Tranzit Technologies, its users, and others. In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Tranzit Technologies’s referral program or has submitted fraudulent documents, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation, or in the European Union or where otherwise required by law, deactivation after human review.
•    using driver location information, and communications between Customers and Drivers/Service Providers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine by using such information that a driver is delaying a delivery pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the customer a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver/service provider to omit such a fee. To object to such an adjustment, please contact Our customer support.
•    Using driver/service provider data (such as location, rating and gender) and customer data (such as rating, origin and destination) to help avoid pairings of users that may result in increased risk of conflict.
To object to a deactivation resulting from these processes, please contact Our customer support.

<p class="font-bold">E. Data retention and deletion</p>
We retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.

We retains user data to provide its services and comply with its legal obligations. 

We retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. The period for which we retain user data is determined by the type of data, the category of user to whom the data relates, and the purposes for which we collected the data.

The length for which We retains user data may further be determined by legal and regulatory requirements, purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or by issues relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute.

For example:

We retain user data of riders and order recipients that is processed in order to provide our services, such as the user profile information and credentials, for the lifetime of the user's account.
We retain certain categories of users for a maximum of 7 years regardless of the lifetime of the user's account, such as location data used to calculate the fee of the trip to comply with Tax regulations.
We retain certain categories of data of all users for a period unrelated to the lifetime of the user's account, to avoid fraudulent use of the app. The period for which the data is retained will be determined by the necessity of the data for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, as well as legal and regulatory requirements. Examples include incomplete driver applications, which are retained for 1 year, and rejected driver applications and customer service communications on safety incidents, which are retained for 7 years.
Pursuant to legal and regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute, we may retain certain categories of data after the deletion of the user's account, such as user profile information, vehicle and tax data. This generally means that we retain their account and data for 7 years after a deletion request.
Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. We may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for reasons stated in this policy.


Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings > Privacy menus in the Our app, or through Our’s website (riders and order recipients here; drivers and delivery persons here; guest checkout users here).

Following an account deletion request, We deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for the applicable statutory retention period after a deletion request. For riders and order recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.

<p class="font-bold">IV. Choice and transparency</p>
We enables users to access and/or control data that We collects, including through: 

privacy settings
device permissions
in-app ratings pages
marketing choices 
We also enables users to request access to or copies of their data, make changes or updates to their accounts, request deletion of their accounts, or request that We restrict its processing of user data.

<p class="font-bold">A. Privacy settings</p>

The Settings > Privacy menu in the app allows riders and order recipients to set or update their preferences regarding location data collection and sharing, emergency data sharing, and notifications. Our Privacy Center is also available in web version.

<p class="font-bold">Location data collection</p>

User can enable/disable app to share their real-time location data from their mobile devices with their drivers through their device settings, which can be accessed via the Settings > My Profile > Address. 
Emergency Data Sharing

We collects location data to track the location of drivers and show order status on the customer app so the customer easily tracks his order status through the app. When the app is closed or not in use, data is not trackable.

In the Agent app, we are tracking the location of the agent in the background mode as well while they are working for us, as soon as they mark their off Duty and clear the application from the background, we do not take the location or track the agent.

Users may enable app to send push notifications about discounts and news from App. Push notifications may be enabled or disabled through the Backend panel.
Communications from restaurants and merchants

While placing an order in the app, users may opt-in to share their contact details with certain restaurants or merchants in order to receive communications from them. 
<p class="font-bold">B. Device permissions</p>

Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owner’s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained. Please check the available settings on your device or check with your provider.

<p class="font-bold">C. In-app ratings pages</p>

After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders.

This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders.

Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the app, and also access a breakdown of their average rating in Our’s Privacy Center.

Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the our Driver app. Click here for more information.

Delivery persons may also be rated by order recipients, restaurants and merchants. Click here for more information.
